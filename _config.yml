# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole site, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing these this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.github_repo }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

# Callouts
#
# The title of a callout is optional. It is rendered in uppercase.
#
# Each kind of callout has a color, used for the callout bar, the title, and the background.
# Predefined colors: grey-lt, grey-dk, purple, blue, green, yellow, red.
# If you use another color, you should define its levels (000, 100, 200, 300) in _sass/custom/custom.scss.
#
# The default is for callout backgrounds to have a lower color level than the bars and titles.
# The value of `callouts_level` is either `quiet` or `loud`:
# `loud` increases the saturation and lightness of the backgrounds.
# The default for `callouts_level` is `quiet` when using the `light` or custom color schemes,
# and `loud` when using the `dark` color scheme.
#
# Examples (not provided by default):
