## Reputation on MTurk

MTurk workers crowdsource knowledge about the reliability and fairness of requesters. The following are just a few sites where workers review requesters. We should periodically check in and make sure our lab is still in good standing with the broader MTurk community:

* [TurkerView](https://turkerview.com){:target="_blank"} [Niv lab](https://turkerview.com/requesters/A3RR9T5E327UK4-niv-lab){:target="_blank"} [CCNP](https://turkerview.com/requesters/AM1AURPCUOXG1-yael-niv){:target="_blank"}
* [TurkerView forum](https://forum.turkerview.com/forums/daily-mturk-hits-threads.2/){:target="_blank"}
* [Turkopticon](https://turkopticon.info/){:target="_blank"}
* [Turker Nation](http://www.turker-nation.com/){:target="_blank"}
* [r/mturk](https://www.reddit.com/r/mturk/){:target="_blank"}

Prolific has a smaller community of workers than MTurk, and so its community resources are not as well-developed (there is no equivalent of TurkerView, for instance). Sometimes workers post on the [Prolific subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProlificAc/){:target="_blank"}, so that can be a good place to go to develop an intuition for what the experience of being a worker is like.
