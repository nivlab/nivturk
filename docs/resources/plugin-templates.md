# JSPsych plugin templates

In addition to [all of the built-in plugins](https://www.jspsych.org/plugins/overview/){:target="_blank"} that are distributed with JSPsych, we have built up a library of custom plugins that are frequently used in our experiments.

A full list of these can be found in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/nivlab/nivturk-templates){:target="_blank"}. Some useful ones include:

- A [demographic questionnaire](https://github.com/nivlab/nivturk-templates/tree/master/questionnaires/demographics){:target="_blank"}
- A [template for survey questions](https://github.com/nivlab/nivturk-templates/blob/master/questionnaires/jspsych-survey-template.js){:target="_blank"}
- A [function to test the participant's audio](https://github.com/nivlab/nivturk-templates/tree/master/instructions/audio-test){:target="_blank"}
- A [bandit task demo](https://github.com/nivlab/nivturk-templates/tree/master/tasks/bandit){:target="_blank"}

Users should feel free to add to this template repo as more functionality is developed.
