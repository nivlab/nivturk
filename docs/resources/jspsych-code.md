## jsPsych code

In addition to all of the built-in [plugins](https://www.jspsych.org/plugins/overview/){:target="_blank"} that are distributed with jsPsych, the Niv/Daw labs have built up a library of custom plugins that are frequently used in our experiments.

A full list of these can be found in [nivturk-templates](https://github.com/nivlab/nivturk-templates){:target="_blank"}. Some useful ones include:

- A [plugin](https://github.com/nivlab/nivturk-templates/tree/master/questionnaires/demographics){:target="_blank"} for the NIH demographics questionnaire
- A [plugin](https://github.com/nivlab/nivturk-templates/blob/master/questionnaires/jspsych-survey-template.js){:target="_blank"} for Likert scales with quality assurance measures
- A [function](https://github.com/nivlab/nivturk-templates/tree/master/instructions/audio-test){:target="_blank"} to test the participant's audio
- A [bandit task demo](https://github.com/nivlab/nivturk-templates/tree/master/tasks/bandit){:target="_blank"}
- Executive functioning tests, including the [progressive matrices](https://github.com/nivlab/nivturk-templates/tree/master/neuropsych/rpm) and the [symmetry span](https://github.com/nivlab/nivturk-templates/tree/master/tasks/symmetry_span)

Users should feel free to add to this repository as useful tools are developed.
