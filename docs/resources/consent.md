# Consent forms

There are several standard Princeton IRB consent forms that are already written up as html documents:

### Niv lab

The Niv lab consent form is [here](https://github.com/nivlab/nivturk/blob/prolific/app/templates/consent.html), and is also set as the default `consent.html` in the v1.0 release of NivTurk. Note that:

- You will need to update the text at line 42 to reflect the duration of your experiment, and
- You may need to comment out lines 57-69 if you are not using psychiatric symptom questionnaires.

### Daw lab

The Daw lab consent form is [here](/link/to/be/filled/by/sam)
