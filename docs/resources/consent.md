# Consent forms

The most up-to-date IRB consent forms for online behavioral experiments for the Niv and Daw lab are already available as HTML documents:

- [Niv lab](https://github.com/nivlab/nivturk-templates/blob/master/consent/niv.html) (default consent form in NivTurk)
- [Daw lab](https://github.com/nivlab/nivturk-templates/blob/master/consent/daw.html)

### For Niv lab experimenters

Please note that before running an experiment, you may need to make several changes to the consent form:

- You will need to update the text at [line 42](https://github.com/nivlab/nivturk-templates/blob/master/consent/niv.html#L42) to reflect the duration of your experiment (note: the red font is only there to remind you to change this portion of the consent form).
- You may need to comment out [lines 57-69](https://github.com/nivlab/nivturk-templates/blob/master/consent/niv.html#L57) if you are not using psychiatric symptom questionnaires.

### For Daw lab experimenters

Please note that before running an experiment, you may need to make several changes to the consent form:

- You will need to update the text at [line 53](https://github.com/nivlab/nivturk-templates/blob/master/consent/daw.html#L53) and [line 77](https://github.com/nivlab/nivturk-templates/blob/master/consent/daw.html#L77) to reflect the duration of your experiment.
- Please consult the latest version of the online behavioral experiments IRB for guidelines on paying participants.
