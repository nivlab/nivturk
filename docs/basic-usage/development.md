This page describes how to integrate an existing jsPsych experiment with NivTurk. It does not go into how to develop the jsPsych experiment itself. For tutorials and examples of jsPsych experiments, you can check out the [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/latest/tutorials/hello-world/) and [jsPsych-demos](https://nivlab.github.io/jspsych-demos/) pages.

If you are new to JavaScript, you can find plenty of resources for getting started on the web. Two examples are [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-code-in-javascript){:target="_blank"} and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/){:target="_blank"}.

## Integrating your experiment

Integrating an existing jsPsych experiment into NivTurk is relatively straightforward. There are only a few steps to follow.

### Download NivTurk

First you will need to clone or download NivTurk. For details, please see the download & install [page](../installation).

### Copy your files

Next you need to copy your files into the NivTurk `app` folder. In general, we recommend sorting your files according to the predefined folder directories (e.g. place JavaScript files in `/app/static/js`), but this is not required.

Note that by default NivTurk ships with jsPsych v6.3.1. You may upgrade or downgrade the default copy of jsPsych as needed (though of course we recommend using later versions).

### Copy your timeline

Then copy your jsPsych timeline into the main experiment file (`/app/templates/experiment.html`). Make sure to import all requisite files in the `<HEAD>` block of the file.

Alternately, if you have a preexisting experiment HTML file, you may overwrite the default `experiment.html` file with it (e.g. rename your file as `experiment.html` and copy it into the `/app/templates/` directory).

If you choose the second approach, you will need to make sure of two things. First, you need to make sure to import the NivTurk plugins (`/app/static/js/nivturk-plugins.js`).

Second, you will need to include the following code in the `on_finish` section of your `jsPsych.init` call. For Prolific users, the code to include is below. (For a complete example, see [here](https://github.com/nivlab/nivturk/blob/prolific/app/templates/experiment.html)):

```html
{%raw%}if (low_quality) {

  // Save rejected dataset to disk.
  redirect_reject("{{workerId}}", "{{assignmentId}}", "{{hitId}}", "{{code_reject}}");

} else {

  // Save complete dataset to disk.
  redirect_success("{{workerId}}", "{{assignmentId}}", "{{hitId}}", "{{code_success}}");

}{%endraw%}
```

For MTurk users, the code to include is below. (For a complete example, see [here](https://github.com/nivlab/nivturk/blob/mturk/app/templates/experiment.html)):

```html
{%raw%}if (low_quality) {

  // Save rejected dataset to disk.
  redirect_reject("1005");

} else {

  // Save complete dataset to disk.
  redirect_success("{{workerId}}", "{{assignmentId}}", "{{hitId}}",  "{{a}}", "{{tp_a}}", "{{b}}", "{{tp_b}}", "{{c}}", "{{tp_c}}");

}{%endraw%}
```

The functions `redirect_success` and `redirect_reject` are NivTurk functions (defined in `/app/static/js/nivturk-plugins.js`) that allow for jsPsych to communicate with NivTurk at the end of an experiment. Specifically, these functions are responsible for both data saving and participant redirects at the end of an experiment.

Note that we include different metadata depending on whether we are using Prolific or MTurk. This is because of the different completion dynamics of the two recruitment pages; see the [Using Prolific](../prolific) and [Using MTurk](../mturk) pages for more information.

## Testing your experiment

### Start the Flask server

To test out the application (but not to serve an actual experiment, see [Serving experiments](..//serving)) we can use Flask's default web server. From the NivTurk folder, run the following commands:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=app.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
export FLASK_RUN_PORT=9000
flask run --host=0.0.0.0
```

The first two lines tell Flask what application and in what mode to run. The third line specifies the port number. The final line starts the web server, and the `host` argument specifies to use an [externally visible server](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/).

With the Flask server running, you should be able to reach the experiment by navigating to:

```
# for Prolific
http://<ip-address>:9000/?PROLIFIC_PID=<xxx>

# for MTurk
http://<ip-address>:9000/?workerId=<xxx>
```

For testing purposes, you will need to provide a dummy ID so that NivTurk lets you continue.


### Debug mode

NivTurk is designed such that participants cannot re-access pages by pressing back or refresh while they are completing the task. Although this is desirable for online recruitment sites (since we want to ensure that participants do not re-start tasks to improve their performance), this may cause headaches during the development of new tasks.

To deal with this, NivTurk has a built-in debugging mode that will temporarily turn off the controls that prevent participants from re-accessing pages. The debug mode is set by the following code at [Line 9](https://github.com/nivlab/nivturk/blob/prolific/app/app.ini#L9) of the `app.ini` file. When `DEBUG = true`, cookies are reset on every new page visit. The debug mode is turned on by default, but should be turned off before running an actual experiment.

Note, even with debug mode on, you will need to specify a new user ID (i.e. `PROLIFIC_PID` for the Prolific branch, `workerId` for the MTurk branch) for each new test of an experiment.

## For Niv / Daw lab researchers

### Consent forms

The most up-to-date IRB consent forms for online behavioral experiments run in the Niv and Daw lab are already available as HTML documents:

- [Niv lab](https://github.com/nivlab/jspsych-demos/blob/main/tasks/consent/niv.html) (default consent form in NivTurk)
- [Daw lab](https://github.com/nivlab/jspsych-demos/blob/main/tasks/consent/daw.html)

<b>Niv lab researchers</b><br>Please note that before running an experiment, you may need to make several changes to the consent form:

- You will need to update the text at [line 42](https://github.com/nivlab/jspsych-demos/blob/main/tasks/consent/niv.html#L42) to reflect the duration of your experiment (note: the red font is only there to remind you to change this portion of the consent form).
- You may need to comment out [lines 57-69](https://github.com/nivlab/jspsych-demos/blob/main/tasks/consent/niv.html#L57) if you are not using psychiatric symptom questionnaires.

<b>Daw lab researchers</b><br>Please note that before running an experiment, you may need to make several changes to the consent form:

- You will need to update the text at [line 53](https://github.com/nivlab/jspsych-demos/blob/main/tasks/consent/daw.html#L53) and [line 77](https://github.com/nivlab/jspsych-demos/blob/main/tasks/consent/daw.html#L77) to reflect the duration of your experiment.
- Please consult the latest version of the online behavioral experiments IRB for guidelines on paying participants.

### Mental health resources

For any Niv or Daw lab experiment involving psychiatric symptom measures, we requiring by the IRB to include the following [page](https://github.com/nivlab/jspsych-demos/blob/main/tasks/self-report/jspsych-mental-health-alert.js) of mental health resources.
