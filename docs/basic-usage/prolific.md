# Using Prolific

{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

This page gives a step-by-step guide to getting an experiment set up on Prolific using NivTurk.

This assumes that you already have working experiment code in your `experiment.html` file, and that you have tested it locally (as well as testing its data-saving on a server).

## Initialising the Prolific study
From the Prolific dashboard, either click 'New study', or duplicate a previous study from within the 'Completed' tab on the sidebar (click 'Action', then 'Duplicate').

<br>
#### Study details
- Add a brief description of your study, including an estimated completion time.
- If desired, under 'Show advanced', you can create an internal label to refer to this this study. This can be useful if you want to refer to it later in other studies (e.g., preventing those who completed this study from accessing a later study).

<br>
#### URL and adding URL arguments
- For the question 'How do you want to record Prolific IDs?', select the option 'I'll use URL parameters'.
- Set the URL for your experiment to the desired URL in the format `http://<ip-address>:<port-number>/`, as discussed on the [Serving experiments page](../serving). Make sure you include the forward slash `/` at the end, and make sure that you do not include the angle brackets.
- NivTurk expects several arguments to be provided from Prolific in the study URL. To add these, click 'Show advanced' and press the toggle button on, so that it reads 'Yes, include them'. They should get added above, so that the 'What is the URL of your study?' box should look something like `http://128.112.102.220:9006/?PROLIFIC_PID={{%PROLIFIC_PID%}}&STUDY_ID={{%STUDY_ID%}}&SESSION_ID={{%SESSION_ID%}}`

<br>
#### Copying study link to NivTurk
- For the question 'How do you want to confirm participants have completed your study?', select 'I'll redirect them using a URL'.
- Prolific will then provide a default completion code (if you have duplicated the study, this code will be the same as in the study you duplicated from). The completion code is the 8-digit alphanumeric code in the link: `https://app.prolific.co/submissions/complete?cc=<code>`. Now that this is updated, you can launch your experiment via gunicorn as detailed [here](../serving/#serving-via-gunicorn-production).
- Copy this code onto your clipboard and paste it into `app.ini` in the NivTurk folder (line 15, replacing the default code `PROLIFIC_CODE_GOES_HERE`).

<br>
#### Audience
- Under 'I want to apply custom prescreening', we always screen based on Current Country of Residence, since we do not have IRB approval to recruit in countries within the European Union. Countries we can recruit from include the USA, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
- If you want to exclude participants who participated in previous studies, you can do so via Participation on Prolific > Previous Studies
- If you want to include participants based on their Prolific IDs, you can do so via Custom Screener > Custom Allowlist. This is helpful for recruiting back participants who took part in previous studies.
- Under 'Which devices should participants use', make sure only 'Desktop' is selected.

<br>
#### Launching study
Once you have specified the completion time, payment amount, and sample size, you can launch your experiment. If you need extra funds, you will be prompted to add them here.

The 'Preview' option gives you the chance to see the study advertisement as participants see it.
