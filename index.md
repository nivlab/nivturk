# NivTurk

NivTurk is a lightweight software solution for running online behavioral experiments. It is designed to be plug-and-play, requiring only a python environment, a jsPsych experiment, and a server configured for hosting websites.

## Site Layout

This site has five sections. New users should start with the [getting started](/nivturk/docs/detailed-documentation/getting-started) page of the detailed documentation.

[Quickstart](/nivturk/docs/quickstart): contains the minimal set of code for setting up a study using the NivTurk architecture. Intended for use by users who have already read through the documentation.

[Detailed documentation](/nivturk/docs/detailed-documentation): describing the major organization of NivTurk, containing pages like "code architecture", "how to serve experiments", "how to integrate your experiment into NivTurk"

[Cookbook](/nivturk/docs/quickstart): recipes for more advanced NivTurk usage (e.g. message passing to trigger session variable updates, multi-stage experiments)

[Resources](/nivturk/docs/resources/): various helpful things for collecting data, such as our reputation info, consent forms, etc.
