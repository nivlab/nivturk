  {% elif errornum == 1003 %}

  <p>Sorry, there was a technical error in our processing of your study. Most likely this means an important component of the experiment failed to load.</p>

  <p>Sorry, our records indicate that you have already completed (or attempted to complete) this study. If you have not previously completed the study, you may have reached this page because you pressed refresh, back, or opened the study in a new browser window.</p>

  <p>Because this is a psychology experiment, you can only complete this study once, and you cannot restart the study if you have previously begun it. Please return the study so someone else can perform the experiment.</p>

  {% elif errornum == 1005 %}

  <p>We have detected unusual or noncompliant activity from your account. Most likely this means we detected you were responding randomly or showing a lack of engagement with the task. Please note that if we detect similar behavior from your account in the future, you may be permanently excluded from all future experiments.</p>

  <p>If you would like to receive partial compensation, or if you have reached this page following an error, please send us a message on Prolific describing the error that you experienced.</p>
